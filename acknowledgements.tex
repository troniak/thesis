\chapter{Acknowledgements}      %% Optional
%This thesis would not have been possible if not for my supervisors Professor Dinesh Pai and Professor Michiel van de Panne, whose guidance, patience and trust allowed me to guide this project to its full potential. 
%They are both phenomenal mentors, and together brought complementary perspectives to this work, enhancing both its depth and breadth. 
%Individual thanks go to Professor Pai for securing the robotic system and for providing high-level direction and feedback, and to Professor van de Panne for providing concrete instruction and for never failing to find ample time in his busy schedule for stimulating discussion.

%Thanks also to Chuan Zhu, my lab-mate, with whom I shared much elation (and dissapointment!), for providing encouragement and comedy in the late-hours before deadlines. I also wish to thank Prof. Pai and Prof. Ian Mitchell, who, through their project courses (CPSC548 and CPSC515) at UBC, allowed me to pursue my interests in the early stages of my graduate career which eventually led me my current focus of study.  

%Special thanks to Professor van de Panne and all members of the MOCCA reading group for listening to my (sometimes mundane) talks on topics related to my thesis. Similar thanks go to Professor Pai and the SMRT reading group for helping me guide topics in Neuroscience into this thesis.

%Last but certainly not least, I would like to thank my family, both in Canada and in Taiwan, for their tireless effort to keep me secure, well-rested (and well-fed!) during the process of writing this thesis.
